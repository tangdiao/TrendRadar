                            >„ÄêChina Seeks to Store Foreign Sovereign Gold to Boost Global Market Role„ÄëChina is seeking to become a global custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves to bolster its position in the international bullion market, according to sources familiar with the matter. The People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC), through the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE), has been encouraging central banks from friendly nations to purchase and store gold within China‚Äôs borders. This initiative aligns with Beijing‚Äôs broader goal of reducing dependence on the US dollar and Western financial hubs such as London and Switzerland. The reserves would be housed in SGE-linked custodian warehouses and consist of newly acquired gold that contributes to foreign countries&#x27; reserves, rather than relocating existing stockpiles. While China‚Äôs domestic gold market is the largest globally, its reported central bank reserves rank fifth worldwide, far behind the UK‚Äôs 5,000 tons stored in the Bank of England‚Äôs vaults. However, the PBOC has been on a gold-buying spree for ten consecutive months, and demand from central banks has helped push gold prices to record highs. China has also eased restrictions on gold imports and launched offshore vaults and yuan-denominated gold contracts in Hong Kong to internationalize its currency and increase trading volumes. This move could attract nations looking to secure reserves and mitigate risks of financial isolation, particularly after the US and allies froze Russia‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves in 2022.</a>

                            >„ÄêGold Hits Record High on U.S. Rate-Cut Hopes„ÄëGold prices continue to push higher, setting a record high on Tuesday on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates further this year. In early trade, futures rise 0.4% to $3,788.80 a troy ounce, after touching $3,795.10 earlier in the session as traders await Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#x27;s speech for further policy cues. Meanwhile, Fed Gov. Stephen Miran made the case that interest rates are too high. Miran said steeper cuts are needed to avoid unnecessary damage to the labor market. &lt;b&gt;The precious metal is up 43.5% this year, driven by strong safe-haven demand, ETF inflows, a softer dollar, and continued diversification by central banks away from dollar holdings. Traders now await Friday&#x27;s U.S. personal consumption expenditures data, which could boost the case for additional monetary stimulus.&lt;/b&gt;</a>

                            >„ÄêFed Can&#x27;t Hand out Cuts Like Candy at a Party: Swissquote„ÄëThe U.S. two-year yield has rebounded past 3.60% even after Trump-linked economist Stephen Miran argued that the neutral rate is much lower than current levels and that he would cut rates by 150 basis points very quickly to get there. It&#x27;s the kind of comments that are so far-stretched they can&#x27;t be taken seriously enough to shift market expectations, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. Proof? The two-year yields have moved higher, she adds. That&#x27;s a sign that lowering rates wouldn&#x27;t necessarily bring down long-term borrowing costs if the size and the speed of easing aren&#x27;t warranted, she says. The reality is that the Fed can&#x27;t hand out rate cuts like candy at a party, she says.</a>

Amid political pressure, the FOMC resumed exiting its restrictive monetary policy despite elevated inflation, the economist says in a note. However, there is limited risk of stoking inflation further due to weak domestic demand and slower income growth, Kohl writes. &lt;b&gt;&quot;We are becoming increasingly confident that rates will continue to be cut gradually at each of the forthcoming meetings until March 2026.&quot; The policy stance will then shift to being broadly neutral, with a Fed funds target rate of 3.00%-3.25%, he says.&lt;/b&gt;</a>

                                target="_blank">„ÄêChina Seeks to Store Foreign Sovereign Gold to Boost Global Market Role„ÄëChina is seeking to become a global custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves to bolster its position in the international bullion market, according to sources familiar with the matter. The People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC), through the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE), has been encouraging central banks from friendly nations to purchase and store gold within China‚Äôs borders. This initiative aligns with Beijing‚Äôs broader goal of reducing dependence on the US dollar and Western financial hubs such as London and Switzerland. The reserves would be housed in SGE-linked custodian warehouses and consist of newly acquired gold that contributes to foreign countries&#x27; reserves, rather than relocating existing stockpiles. While China‚Äôs domestic gold market is the largest globally, its reported central bank reserves rank fifth worldwide, far behind the UK‚Äôs 5,000 tons stored in the Bank of England‚Äôs vaults. However, the PBOC has been on a gold-buying spree for ten consecutive months, and demand from central banks has helped push gold prices to record highs. China has also eased restrictions on gold imports and launched offshore vaults and yuan-denominated gold contracts in Hong Kong to internationalize its currency and increase trading volumes. This move could attract nations looking to secure reserves and mitigate risks of financial isolation, particularly after the US and allies froze Russia‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves in 2022.</a>

In early trade, futures rise 0.4% to $3,788.80 a troy ounce, after touching $3,795.10 earlier in the session as traders await Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#x27;s speech for further policy cues. Meanwhile, Fed Gov. Stephen Miran made the case that interest rates are too high. Miran said steeper cuts are needed to avoid unnecessary damage to the labor market. &lt;b&gt;The precious metal is up 43.5% this year, driven by strong safe-haven demand, ETF inflows, a softer dollar, and continued diversification by central banks away from dollar holdings. Traders now await Friday&#x27;s U.S. personal consumption expenditures data, which could boost the case for additional monetary stimulus.&lt;/b&gt;</a>

It&#x27;s the kind of comments that are so far-stretched they can&#x27;t be taken seriously enough to shift market expectations, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. Proof? The two-year yields have moved higher, she adds. That&#x27;s a sign that lowering rates wouldn&#x27;t necessarily bring down long-term borrowing costs if the size and the speed of easing aren&#x27;t warranted, she says. The reality is that the Fed can&#x27;t hand out rate cuts like candy at a party, she says.</a>

Amid political pressure, the FOMC resumed exiting its restrictive monetary policy despite elevated inflation, the economist says in a note. However, there is limited risk of stoking inflation further due to weak domestic demand and slower income growth, Kohl writes. &lt;b&gt;&quot;We are becoming increasingly confident that rates will continue to be cut gradually at each of the forthcoming meetings until March 2026.&quot; The policy stance will then shift to being broadly neutral, with a Fed funds target rate of 3.00%-3.25%, he says.&lt;/b&gt;</a>
