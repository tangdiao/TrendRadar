Trump‚Äôs attempt to save the platform is a reversal from his first term, when he sought to ban it, then blessed a tentative agreement to save it in which Oracle and Walmart would have invested. The deal never went through. Co-founded by Republican megadonor Larry Ellison, the world‚Äôs second-richest person, &lt;b&gt;Oracle &lt;/b&gt;hosts TikTok user data and is expected to be involved in the new agreement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;China&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- China‚Äôs Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang told reporters in Madrid that a framework of ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù had been reached on TikTok, while cautioning that Beijing won‚Äôt sacrifice principles for a deal. China opposes the politicization and weaponization of technology and trade matters and will safeguard its national interests and the rights and interests of its companies, Li said.&lt;br/&gt;- Wang Jingtao, a deputy director of China‚Äôs Cyberspace Administration, referred to methods such as the entrusted operation of TikTok‚Äôs US user data, and mentioned algorithms and intellectual property rights, without getting into specifics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ahead of the Talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth spoke with their Chinese counterparts. Had there been no deal on TikTok, a Trump-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in South Korea late next month would have been off the table, the official said.&lt;br/&gt;- Ahead of the talks on Sunday, China launched two investigations targeting the US semiconductor industry.&lt;br/&gt;- On Monday, China‚Äôs market regulator said that a preliminary investigation found Nvidia was in violation of the country‚Äôs anti-competition laws, adding that a further probe into the U.S. chip giant will be carried out.</a>
